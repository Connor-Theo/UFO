# UFO

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take the original filtering process for Dana’s UFO sightings web page and take it a step further. In doing so I removed the button mechanic, and added additional filters for the UFO sightings City, State, Country, and object Shape.  The original webpage was set up for the user to filter by date and click a search button to filter.  The button was removed, and the webpage will automatically filter results as criteria is specified!

## Results
The web page was successfully updated to allow the user to simply input criteria specific to the sighting’s location (city, state, country) and objects shape, in addition to the date.  Once the user specifies even one of these criteria the web page will automatically update its results, while there are four possible ways to specify a sighting the web page only requires one.  This allows our users to be as specific as they wish when searching for aliens.

## Summary
In my opinion, one drawback that stuck out to me is the inability to search for key words in a sighting’s description.  This would be useful for a user if there was a specific comment a user wishes to find, or show a friend, you could simply use a (ctrl + f) and search for the key word manually. But that operates under the assumption that every user is privy to this function.  While I think the latter could be an additional recommendation for the web page, I also believe that storing any photographs/videos captured by the observer could be a neat addition too.  As we know, UFOs are notoriously tricky to get eyes on, even if it adds to the conspiracy of their existence or not, pictures are always a nice touch.  Overall, I believe this web page is a fun way of parsing through UFO sightings across the world rather quickly.
